Hey. [taking Jerry's couch cushion] Yeah. Yeah. Elaine, she has to leave her armoire on the street all night...I'm gonna guard it for her. I need something to sit on. Yeah, but this is so nice and thick. Ahoy there! Yeah. Well, you ask for it, you got it. Well, a bowl of mulligatawny would hit the spot. Yeah. It's an Indian soup. It's simmered to perfection by one of the great soup artisans in the modern era. He's not a Nazi. He just happens to be a little eccentric. Most geniuses are. Wait a second. You don't even know how to order. No. No, Elaine! Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. What are you doing? You can't take this. This belongs to a friend of mine. Huh? What is this, huh? Well, b -- it was stolen. These street toughs, they robbed me. Yeah. It was very frightening. My life was in danger. You should've seen the way they talked to me. Well, where's the soup? Oh... yeah! Yeah. Yeah. Elaine, I'm really sorry about the armoire. No. Yeah. They were..quite taken with it. Hey. All right, [claps hands] I'm gonna go get some soup. And then they just ran off with the armoire, just like that. Well, my friend is awful disappointed is all. You know, she's very emotional. How can I possibly thank you? You suffer for your soup. You demand perfection from yourself, from your soup. Git. And..voila! Yeah. Yeah. Did the K Man do it or did the K Man do it? Yeah! How 'bout zero? Yeah. I'll tell ya where I got it. I got it from the guy you so callously refer to as the soup nazi. Yeah. Well, I told him the whole story and he just let me have it. Wha -- Yeah. He's a wonderful man. Yeah. Well, a little bit misunderstood but, uh.... Yeah. Well, he's a dear. Oh. Jerry, those are the guys that mugged me for the armoire. Yeah. Yeah. That's them. No. No. No. No. Let's get a cop. No! Excuse me. Uh, well, uh, we -- Well, wha -- I, uh -- uh, we were kind of, uh, talking to each other, weren't we? [Jerry & Kramer turn around and run away] You can have this one. It's this way. No, no, I got it. If you like her, go talk to her. She's fat. I thought it was here. Blue-one. I thought it was blue-one. It looks familiar. I remember the elevator. Dark blue. Didn't we come in over there? About two hours. Why don't you go behind one of these cars? J Why? Nobody's around. You know when you hold it in like that you can cause a lot of damage to your bladder. That's what happens to truck drivers. They hold it in all the time. Eventually it starts coming out involuntarily. Jerry, are you aware that adult diapers are a six hundred million dollar a year industry? I'm gonna put it down behind that car. HE DOES SO. Pink eleven. Remember that. Look at this place. It's huge... It's got to be here. I have a pen. I found it! Oh...no. It was easy the last time. Right here at the mall. You drank a whole bottle of water. So why don't you just go? Don't you get tired of following rules? Why be uncomfortable if you don't have to? It's organic. Buddy Hackett? I know. (pointing) You can go over here. It'll take you ten seconds. Jerry! Does that bother you? Not at all. I once saw this thing on T.V. with people who are terminally ill. And they all believed the secret of life is just to live every moment. The guy's got a fat fetish. Spector never dates a woman under two hundred-fifty pounds. What does he do with all that fat? Does he just jump up and down on it? Does he gouge it like Killer Kowalski? He was a wrestler. He would grab hold of someone's stomach and just squeeze it until they gave. So go. You and Jerry. George! George! Jerry? Boy I had a helluva time finding that air-conditioner. I looked everywhere. I completely forgot where I hid it. You know where it was? Right! Purple 23. I could've used you. What time is it? Well at least there's no traffic. What time does that play start? That might be a problem. Where's your little bag of... Oh... Boy this garage is going to cost a fortune. You know how long we were here? Alright. I'm ready. You know, I still don't understand - why do you want to move back in with your parents? Well, move in here. Why doesn't he just move in here? You can move in with me, if you want. Well, I gotta bring in more stuff. Yeah. Uhh… no thanks. Alright, that's it. Anything else? Oh, I gotta go move the car. Yeah, well, that was a good one. You know that, uh, Leslie is in the clothing business? She's a designer. In fact, she's come up with a new one that is going to be the big new look in men's fashion.. It's a, a puffy shirt. Well, yeah, it - it's all puffy. Like the pirates used to wear. Yeah, see, I think people want to look like pirates. You know, it's the right time for it to be all puffy, and devil-may-care. That's true… I'll be right back. Hey. Hey, George! What?! But, it's only a toy! A hand model? Really? Let me see your hands. Let's see... oh, those are nice. You know, I've never noticed this before? They're smooth.. creamy.. delicate, yet masculine. Yeah.. You're not going to believe what happening with Leslie. You know, ever since you agreed to wear the puffy shirt on the Today show, she's been getting all these orders from boutiques and department stores.. Agreed to wear the puffy shirt. When you said that you'd agree to wear the puffy shirt on the Today show. Yea. Yeah, yeah. When we went to dinner the other night. What were you talking about when I went to the bathroom? There you go. Yes, yes! You said it! Well, she asked you. Well, you gotta wear it now! All those stores are stocking it based on the condition that you're gonna wear this on the TV show! The factory in New Jersey is already makin' em. Yes, yes. This pirate trend that she's come up with, Jerry, this-this is gonna be the new look for the 90's. You're gonna be the first pirate! Yeah, come in. Giddy-Up. Jerry! Five minutes! Now that's a great looking shirt! Aye Captain! Yeah! I'm glad I ironed it. It's perfect. Look at it! It's fantastic! Hey, this look's better than anything you own. You know, in two months time, everybody's gonna be wearing the [imitates a pirate] pirate look! Yeah. Great. It's the puffy shirt. Look at it, eh? Whatd'ya think? Is it cool or what? Elaine, you want to stop? Hey.. Well, I was excited because Jerry was putting on the puffy shirt. You know all those stores canceled out on her? She's finished. (Concluding) We're (Leslie and him) finished. I just can't be with someone who's life is in complete disarray. They gave them all to Goodwill. [correcting] No, they're not cloning sheep. It's the same sheep! I saw Harry Blackstone do that trick with two goats and a handkerchief on the old Dean Martin show! Yeah, Go! Wha… really? Yeah, ok. Yeah! Bye. Great news! Yeah, the strike has been settled. I'm going back to work. Yeah, H&H Bagels. That's where I worked. Yeah. Look, see. I still have my business card. Yeah, we've been on strike for 12 years. Yeah, well, H&H wouldn't let us use their bath room while we were picketing. It put a cramp on our solidarity. Yeah, 5.35 an hour. And that's what they're paying now. Now you know who to thank for that! Alright, I've got to go. Jerry, I didn't want you to know I was out of work. It's embarrassing! [Setting: H&H Bagel Shop] (Kramer walks through the door) All right, everybody! I'm back! Cosmo Kramer. strikes over. Huh.. wha- Didn't any of the guys come back? Oh, man. Makes you wonder what it was all for.. Alright! Toss me an apron, let's bagel! What are those? I never thought I'd live to see that... Ah, gentlemen.. bagels on the house! Oh, fantastic! It felt so good to get my hands back in that dough. No, I didn't make these bagels. Yeah, they're day-olds. The homeless won't even touch them. Oh, we try to fool them by putting a few fresh ones on top, but they dig... they, they test. What's Festivus? Frank invented a holiday? He's so prolific! Well, just tell me everything, huh? What happened to the doll? That musta been some kind of doll. Is there a tree? Frank, this new holiday of yours is scratching me right where I itch. No. Ah, listen, Harry, I need the 23rd off. But it's Festivus. You know you're infringing on my right to celebrate new holidays.. Well, it's going to be! Because I'm going back on strike. Come on Elaine. It's a walk out! What? You're siding with management?! [Interrupting] Scab! Scab! Well, Happy Festivus. There's a big dinner Tuesday night at Frank's house - everyone's invited. Hello. Protect Festivus! Hey, no bagels, no bagels, no bagels, [continues to chant] Elaine, you should get out of there. I sabotaged the bagel machine last night. It's going down. You've been warned. Hey! How do you like your bagels now?! It's fright night! And? Yeah. Oh, hello. Ah-huh. Ahh... I don't know who you really are, but I've seen Jerry's girlfriend, and she's not you. You're much better looking - and like, a foot taller. Oh, he's a tomcat. Hey! Happy Festivus, everyone! Hee, hee, hee! I told them I was just about to see you.. It's a Festivus miracle! Uh.. that's right. Another Festivus miracle! Uh-oh. Oh, gee, Frank, I'm sorry. I gotta go. I have to work a double shift at H&H. Well, I caved. I mean, I really had to use their bathroom. Frank, no offense, but this holiday is a little [makes noises] out there. Thank - you! [singing] Johnny Yuma was a rebel, yeah! Are you all right? Unh.... Sorry. Yeah. Oh, here, wait wait. Ah, maybe you could ah, use this. Ah, here, it's a electronic organizer... Ah, yeah. Uh... Yeah, here it is... yeah. You know, for phone numbers, addresses, keep appointments, everything. It's got an alarm that beeps! Yeah. No no no. I got all my appointments up here. Well, the bank, I opened up a new account. [overly excited] HEY! [claps] [overly excited] Who wants to have some fun! [overly excited] Now are you just sayin' you want to have fun or do you really want to have fun?! Right now there six-hundred Titleists that I got from the driving range in the trunk of my car. Why don't we drive out to Rock-a-Way… and hit em--- into the ocean! Now picture this... we find a nice sweet spot between the dunes, we take out our drivers, we tee up and [strokes] that ball goes sailing up into the sky holds there for a moment and then... gulp! Yeah! [swings] Hey. Hey ya want these? I don't want em! I stink! I can't play! The ball is just sitting there, Jerry, and I can't hit it! I only hit one really good ball that went way out there! I have no concentration! Sand, I can get rid of the sand. Look there’s still some in here, it won't go away! Look I even got sand in the pockets! Wha-- Oh, hey. Oh, you liked it huh. Oh. The sand, it's everywhere! [blows on arm] Yei- Well come on George, finish the story. Well then, what did you do next? What is that a titleist? A hole in one eh. [quietly] Um-hm. What's with you? Yep. You! Take off your socks, your pants, your underwear. We're doing the wash. C'mon! Take it off, take it off! Hey, Georgie. [laughing] She caught you? Oh, like you're gonna stop? Wait a second, wait a second. Count me in on this. (clicks his tongue) Yeah. Not everyday. No... a thousand! Alright. Hey, look at this, c'mere. There's a naked woman across the street. Second floor from the top. See the window on the left? Yeah… [pause] yeah… I'm out! Yeah, I'm out... I'm out of the contest. Yeah, yeah… what? Well, it was that woman across the street. You know, you better be careful, buddy. She's gonna get you next. [singing] Goood Moorrrnninng! Ha, ha! Nothing like some good solid sack time. Oh. So, did you make it through the night? So, you're still master of your domain. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What-what did you just say? Do you hear what you're saying?! Can you hear it?! This is a beautiful woman walking around naked, and you want to tell her to stop?! That's the dumbest thing I ever heard! I mean, think comprehends- I'm not gonna let you do it. JERRY:[persistent] Well, I'm doin' it, get out of my way. No, no, no, no. You can't! You can't! This is something that comes about once in a lifetime! When we were boys, looking through our bedroom windows, we would think... "Why can't there be a woman out there, taking her clothes off?" And now that wish's come true, and you want to *Pffft* throw it away?! No, I'm not gonna let you do it, Jerry. [frantic] No, no, no. Don't do it. Don't do it! For my sake! God knows I don't ask you for much! [pleading] Now, come on. Please, Jerry. Please! I'm beggin ya! Please! [claps hands] Come on! Please! Yes! Thank you, thank you, thank you. Oh, I can wait..
