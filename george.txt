All right. So, what theatre you wanna go to tonight? We got 61st and 3rd or 84th and Broadway. All right, shmoopies...what's it gonna be? Pick a theater. Hey. Yes. Please. Please, let's go. Oh, there's a soup stand, Kramer's been going there. All right. All right. Let's - let's go over that again. All right. So, you hold out your money, speak your soup in a loud, clear voice, step to the left and receive. This line is huge. Isn't that that Bania guy? Whoop! Too late. I think he picked up the scent. Medium turkey chili. I didn't get any bread. Um, excuse me, I - I think you forgot my bread. $2? But everyone in front of me got free bread. Yes, please. What? You know, I don't see how you can sit there eating that and not even offer me any? Why can't we share? Do you hear yourself? Well, I gotta go back there and try again. Hi Sheila. I'm going. You know what? I changed my mind. I, uh, I don't think so. I just don't feel like it anymore. Just like that. No. I didn't get it. I made a mistake. All right. Well, we'll see what happens to you. Yeah. Hey, let ask you something. Is it just me, or - or do you find it unbearable to be around Jerry and that girl? Why do they have to do that in front of people? What is that with the shmoopy? The shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy, shmmopy, shmoopy! I had to listen to a five minute discussion on which one is actually called shmoopy. And I cancelled plans to go to the movies with them tonight. You know, we absolutely should. I don't know. He can be so weird sometimes. I still haven't figured him out. All right. Shh! I gotta focus. I'm shifting into soup mode. Good afternoon. One large crab bisque to go. Bread. Beautiful. Sorry. Thank you. Oh, this is fabulous. My God Elaine, you have to taste this. Hup! Hup! Hello. Hello. Were you just talking about me? What's going on? Something's going on here. So, how was the movie? Oh, yeah? Happy? Why should I be happy? Why should I care? All right. I am happy, and I'll tell ya why -- because the two of you were making me and every one of your friends sick! Right, Elaine? Yeah. Yeah. With all that kissing and the shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy out in public like that. It's disgusting! People who do that should be arrested. Ye - yeah. And we had a pact, you know. You shook my hand in that coffee shop. Mmm-hmm. You reneged. Ah-ha! Oh, yes. Hello. No, thanks. Yes. Well -- So, uh, sit on the same side at a booth, huh? I, uh, just think it's a little unusual. Two people to sit on one side...and leave the other side empty. Ahh. Good for you. I don't know, honey. What do you want to get? [in babying voice] I want you to get anything you want...'cause I love you so much. I want you to be happy. Okay, sweetie? Well, I could be a little sweetie tweetie weetie weetie. Come here. [George & Susan begin making out; Jerry & Sheila begin making out in order to keep up] How much tip do you leave on $8.15? Huh? Oh, yes. I - I'm your baby bluey. Really? You did? Yeah. See ya. One left...what a joke. No, that's not enough BTUs for my living room...That was a complete waste of time. You should see what my father used to go through before he bought a car. He'd go from state to state. He was away for weeks at a time. It was like he was running for President and he was going through the primaries. We'd get phone calls from motels in New Hampshire. Well at least you accomplished something. You got fish. Fish. What do they do? What time is it? Always late. Always late. I told them to meet me in front of my building at six-fifteen. My parents. It's their anniversary. I'm taking them out to dinner and a show tonight. You think we'll hit traffic? I always get myself in this position. Can't be on time. Gotta rush. Did I need that pointed out for me? What is that going to do for me? How does that help me, to see her? I'm trying to live my life. Don't show me that. Yeah, right. I'll just go up and say, "Hi, how ya' doing? Would you like a glass of white wine?" Before you got within twenty feet of this woman, she'd have her finger on the mace button. She's like an expensive car with one of those motion-sensor force field alarms. Any sudden movement in the area could set her off. You don't know where we parked? Oh, this is great. This is just what I need. There's elevators all over! It all looks the same. You come to a parking lot, you write it down. How hard is that? It's this way... ...Six wrong? Oh I got it. That I'm supposed to remember. Where the car is, that's insignificant. I can tell you this. If I am not in front of my house at six-fifteen, when my parents get there, they will put me on an aggravation installment plan that will compound with interest for decades. Where the hell is this car, Kramer? What? I can't carry a pen. I'm afraid I'll puncture my scrotum. Hey, is that necessary? I think hitting a defenseless child is my business. ...What? You are! I should've hit the little son-of-a-bitch. I can't stand kids. Adults think it's so wonderful how honest kids are. I don't need that kind of honesty. I'll take a deceptive adult over an honest kid any day. Oh are they gonna be furious. Unbelievable, I'm never gonna get out of here. The guy goes to pee, he never comes back. It's like a science fiction story. Oh now you're gonna go? ELAINE I'll be back in five minutes. If you go now, I know what's gonna happen. We'll find the car, Jerry will show up, and then we'll never find you. Oh what's the difference? We'll all be dead eventually. Yeah, it bothers me. Doesn't it bother you? See now that bothers me even more than dying bothers me, cause it's people like you who live to be a hundred and twenty because you're not bothered by it. How could it not bother you? Yeah, yeah. I've heard that. Meanwhile I'm here with you in a parking garage, what am I supposed to do? Really. Who's Killer Kowalski? I've gotta go to the bathroom. Don't you believe me? It's their fiftieth anniversary. You know this is gonna kill him. You're aware of that. Kill him. On the biggest night of his life... A Red Chinese prison? Sure, I have it all the time. Very spicy. Me too. Elaine, shut-up. I don't know. Where's Kramer? See, I knew it. I knew this was gonna happen... Look at the time, that's it. We came in over there! So what do you want me to do? That is an opening. Excuse me...I really... What's happened is that my friend forgot where he parked and if you're not in a big hurry, we'd really appreciate it if... You will? Thanks a lot. I'm really late. My parents are waiting in front of my building and we're stuck here. Yeah, right. It's a blue Honda... Hi Amy, I'm George. I didn't mean anything by it. I don't even know L. Ron Hubbard! I didn't know you were... ...with that group. The car! Kramer, Kramer's not here...I knew it. I knew it! I knew this would happen. (SCREAMING) Kramer! Kramer! Purple 23. Sometimes it's good to have a pencil to write these things down. Seven forty-five. Right. Eight o'clock. I can't believe this. How can I do this? How can I move back in with those people? Please, tell me. They're insane. You know that. How can you compare you parents to my parents?! My father wears his sneakers in the pool! Sneakers! Listen carefully. My mother has never laughed. Ever. Not a giggle, not a chuckle, not a tee-hee... never went 'Ha!' Maybe!.. And I'm moving back in there! No, no, no, no. Borrowing money from a friend is like having sex. It just completely changes the relationship. I don't want to! I'm outta money! I got 714 dollars left in the bank. Yeah, yeah. I'm gonna move in with him. He doesn't even let you use the toilet! Thank you.. I, uh.. that might not work out. There's more. Bologna?! No one eats bologna anymore! No, that's it. What? You're going? Wha - what are you doing later? Really? Yeah... may - maybe I'll meet ya? Oh.. okay.. talk to you later. Oh, my God... I'm not taking a civil service test. Yes, I've seen a silver dollar. To do what?! Work in a post office? Is that what you want me to do? I'm a college graduate. You want me to be a mailman? I don't know. I do know that I have some kind of a talent - something to offer. I just don't know what it is yet! Oh my God. I need some air.. I got a lot of thinking to do. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm terribly sorry.. I, I, I, here, let me - let me help you.. It - it's just that I'm here with my parents, and my mother wants me to take a civil service test - and to tell you the truth, I don't even think I'd pass it.. So.. What? What about them? They are? Hand modeling? Me neither! I don't know. This woman just set me up for a job! What, are you kidding? The knuckles are all out of proportion. you got hair over there - where do you get off comparing your hands to my hands?! This is a one-in-a-million hand. This is it! It happened to me, Jerry! I was sitting in the restaurant, the two nut jobs were talking - I couldn't take it any more. I got up, and I bop into this woman. OH! What are you, crazy?! Are you, crazy?! You coulda damaged my hand! You can look at them, but do NOT touch them. Alright, I gotta get going. That's all I could find. Would you mind getting the door? Thank you very much. Hand me an Emory board. Scissor. Don't hand them to me with the point facing out! You're sorry?! I hope so. Alright! Please, please! I cannot have this constant bickering! Stress is very damaging to the epidermis! Now, I have an important photo session in the morning - my hands have got to be in tip-top shape, so please - keep the television down, and the conversation to a minimum. I'll take it in my room. Who was he? What happened to him? You mean, uh..? But how.. uh..? You don't have to worry about me. (Nodding, gloating) I won a contest. Like that? That's it? Oh, thank you very much. Hey, hey! You can't believe this. Look at this check! They told me I had the most beautiful hands they'd ever seen in their lives - except for this McKigney guy - this great looking girl gave me her phone number.. I got it! I got it all! I'm busting. Jerry, I'm busting! Alright. Nice shirt.. What is this? Is this what you wore on the show? What, have you completely lost your mind? Who's dressing you? You look like a complete idiot! Ow! Hot! Hot! This McKigney guy had a few good years.. How could you forget to turn off an iron? My whole life is ruined because of the (Mocking, bitter tone) "puffy shirt". Oh, yeah. Still in good with the ground crew. I'm gonna get some more of these kosher cocktail franks… Hey. Great! I ate the entire platter! Had to call in sick today. Hey, I work for Kruger Industrial Smoothing: "We don't care, and it shows." Hey, at least I'm bringing something to this. "Have you seen me?" [flicks it aside] Nope. Whoa, something from Whatley. "This holiday season a donation has been made in your name to the Children's Alliance."? I got him Yankee's tickets! He got me a piece of paper saying "I've given your gift to someone else!" Don't you see how wrong that is?! Where's your Christmas spirit? And eye for an eye! Nothing. It's a card from my dad. It's nothing, stop it... [interrupting] Jerry, No! No! [pleading] Alright… Jerry! Stop it! I can't take it anymore! I'm going to work! Are you happy now?! So, attractive one day - not attractive the next? Yes, I am familiar with this syndrome -- she's a two-face. [Annoyed] If that helps you... Clint Eastwood! Hey, check this out. I gotta give out Christmas presents to everyone down at Kruger, so I'm pulling a Whatley. [with pride] Made it up. What do you think? Alright. Uh, well, I'm out of here. [interrupting] No! Stop it! It's nothing. It's a stupid holiday my father invented. It doesn't exist! (Elaine enters while George is exiting) Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas! Here is a little something for you… I loved those cigars! Incoming! Aw, sir. Merry Christmas! The Human Fund. Exactly. So, she was switching? Back and forth? So, just bring her here. This is all you really need. Lights out. Office Christmas gift. I tell you, this Human Fund is a gold mine! I know. I cut the button off and poked a hole with a letter opener. What is that? Is that the pole?! That's why I hate it. I can't read it. I need my glasses! No! No! Turn it off! No feats of strength! I hate Festivus! 20 thousand dollars? Hey! Surprise, surprise! Hey, soup. Hey, take a look at this. I don't know. I've been doing a lot of thinking. This might be my chance to start giving something back. I'm serious. I think I could be a philanthropist. a kick ass philanthropist! I would have all this money, and people would love me. Then they would come to me.. and beg! And if I felt like it, I would help them out. And then they would owe me big time! First thing I'm gonna need is a driver.. Well, there could be. Well, I - I could, Uh, I could give the money back. Here. (Holds it out) Well, sir, I - I gave out the fake card, because, um, I don't really celebrate Christmas. I, um, I celebrate Festivus. Festivus, sir. And, uh, I was afraid that I would be persecuted for my beliefs. They drove my family out of Bayside, Sir! Oh, no, Sir. Festivus is all too real. And... I could prove it - if I had to. Happy Festivus! This is my boss. Dad, he doesn't need to see the pole. Happy Festivus! Yama - Hama! Embracing my roots. Busted cold. Oh, God. Not the feats of strength.. Kramer! You can't go! Who's gonna do the feats of strength? Oh, please, somebody, stop this! Oh, come on! Be sensible. Ow! .. Ow! I give, I give! Uncle! …you can't handle the truth! [salutes] I'm working on my Jack Nicholson, You can't handle the truth! [salutes] Yeah, I grabbed it on the way out, I don't want my mother reading it. Yeah. No, anything. She'll open! Yes. I was curious! [imitating mom’s voice] Maybe I can get her locked up. Hey, did you see that whale thing on TV last night? I am such a Huge whale fan. These marine biologists were showin' how they communicate with each other with these squeaks and squeals, what a fish! Whatever. Hey new tape recorder? Hey. I do. I'm just sayin' I wanna have some fun. Come on. Ya wanna go get some lunch? Yeah, I'm gonna get a paper. Keep your head down. Diane DeConn? You saw Diane DeConn! Ahh! How'd she look? Ahh! Umh! She asked about me? What did- What did she say? George! She said George? She remembered my name. Diane DeConn remembered my name. She was the "it" girl! [pauses] …Ok, I'm tellin you right now - if your kiddin around I'm not gonna be able to be your friend anymore. I'm serious about that. You got that. Good. Cause if this is a lie, if this is a joke, if this is your idea of some cute little game… we're finished! Oh my god he's not kidding. [exhale gasp] A what? (pauses) A marine biologist? Why am I a marine biologist? But I'm not a marine biologist! So? I didn't even know it was a job. Well what if she calls me? What am I supposed to say?! (hand hits the table) Algae,… obviously plankton, hmhm. I don't know what else I could tell ya, ah, Oh I-I just got back from a trip to the Galapagos Islands, I was living with the turtles. I don’t know whatcha had to tell her that for. You put me in a very difficult position, Marine Biologist! I'm very uncomfortable with this whole thing. Well it's not up my alley! It's one thing if I make it up. I know what I'm doin, I know my alleys! You got me in the Galapagos Islands livin with the turtles, I don't know where the hell I am. Look, why couldn't you make me an architect? You know I always wanted to pretend that I was an architect. Well I-I'm supposed to see her tomorrow, I-I-I'm gonna tell her what's goin on. I mean maybe she just likes me for me. How'd she find it? Then of course with evolution, the octopus lost the nostrils and took on the more familiar look that we know today. Yeah, but if you still look closely you can see ah, a little bump where the nose use to be. huhuhuhu. But enough about fish, huhuhu. I can discuss other things you know, ah… architecture. Huhu. (makes a wide gesture with his arms) Oh, they're busting! So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified! But I pressed on -- and as I made my way passed the breakers a strange calm came over me. I-I don't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment… I was a Marine Biologist! I know I was just telling them the story. The sea was angry that day my friends… like an old man trying to send back soup in a deli. I got about fifty-feet out and suddenly, the great beast appeared before me. I tell ya he was ten stories high if he was a foot. As if sensing my presence he let out a great bellow. I said, "Easy big fella!" And then, as I watched him struggling I realized, that something was obstructing its breathing. From where I was standing I could see directly into the eye of the great fish! Whatever. Well then, from out of nowhere, a huge tidal wave lifted me, tossed like a cork and I found myself right on top of him, face-to-face with the blow-hole. I-I, I could barely see from the waves crashing down upon me but, I knew something was there… so I reached my hand in, felt around and pulled out the obstruction! [nods] Ohh yes, yes. Yes Jerry they were all over me. It was like Rocky 1, Hm. Diane came up to me, threw her arms around me… …kissed me. We both had tears streaming down our faces. I never saw anyone so beautiful. It was at that moment that I decided to tell her that, I was not a marine biologist. Told me to "Go to hell!" and I took the bus home. Sand. It's everywhere [shaking head] My mother caught me... You know. I was alone… [nodding] Uh-huh. I stopped by the house to drop the car off, and I went inside for a few minutes.. Nobody was there - they're supposed to be working. My mother had a Glamour magazine, I started leafing through it. ..So, one thing lead to another.. First she screams, "George, what are you doing?! My God!" And it looked like she was gonna faint - she started clutching the wall, trying to hang onto it. I didn't know whether to try and keep her from falling, or zip up. I zipped up! Yeah. [defensively] Well, I couldn't run over there the way I was! So, she fell, and then she started screaming, "My back! My back!" So, I picked her up and took her to the hospital. [somewhat angered] She's in traction. It's not funny, Elaine. Her back went out. She's gotta be there for a couple of days. All she said on the way over in the car was, "Why, George, why?!" I said, "Because it's there!" [vowing] Well, I'll tell you this, though - I am never doing.. THAT , again. All together. You don't think I can? (daring) You think you could? Care to make it interesting? A hundred dollars. Oh, no. Alright, look, you want to be in? You gotta give us odds. At least two to one - you gotta put up two-hundred dollars. Alright, you're in for one-fifty. Alright, now, how are we gonna monitor this thing? ...No, ma, I'm not gonna see a psychiatrist... I don't care if you do pay for it! No! Discussion over. Yeah, alright, I'll see you later. Yes, of course I'm gonna come by. Alright. My mother wants me to see a psychiatrist now. Why?! Because she caught me? [scoffs] You know, if everyone who did that had to go see a psychiatrist… [laughing, he snorts] [defensively] Whatever. [shrugging it off] She'll be fine. I gotta go to the hospital to see her tonight. Hey, what are you doing tonight? Oh, the virgin? Any, uh.. progress, there? What's the latest? [in awe] Wow! Maybe she's a nudist. You know, those nudist colony people.. I would imagine it's all naked. They're naked, the gardeners naked.. the bellhops. One big nude-a-rama. Hey. Not me. Have a good time. You're out?! Every night at six-thirty. The nurse was gorgeous.. then I got a look at the patient.. [laughs, then snorts] I was going nuts. [fake sympathy] Well, my mother, Jerry.. I am king of the county. You? Quite a workout? What did you say? All you got is instant coffee? Why don't you get some real coffee? Where did you get those socks? I think those are my socks! I don't know, but those are my socks! I had a pair just like that with the blue stripe, and now I don't have them anymore! Yeah, well, they're my socks! Oh boy.. …oh boy. Do you believe this? We're fighting. We're fighting. Me too. I've been yelling at strangers on the street. [shocked] You caved?! You're out? I figured you'd cruise. At least through the Spring. Ohhhhh.. John-John. And then, [smacks the money] there were two. (to Elaine) Hey, what happened? I thought you were meeting Kennedy. Yeah, he did. No, no, no. He just left. Yeah, he was talking to Marla. Yeah, I think, you know, she was, like, crying, and he was consoling her, and then, she, uh, just got into his car, and they just drove away. Yeah. Yeah, drove away.. You know, I said 'Hello' to him. You know, he's - he's- Kramer?!
