JERRY:	Let me ask you a question.
ELAINE:	Mm-hm.
JERRY:	You're a hostage, captured by terrorists- 
ELAINE:	[smiling] Who, me?
JERRY:	You, anybody... whatever. You're in the little room, you're chained to the floor, you're there for a long time.. do you think they would ever consider doing the laundry?
ELAINE:	They have to, it's in the Geneva Convention.
KRAMER: You! Take off your socks, your pants, your underwear. We're doing the wash. C'mon! Take it off, take it off!
KRAMER:	Hey, Georgie.
JERRY: Hi.
ELAINE:	Hi.
JERRY:	What's the matter?
GEORGE:	[shaking head] My mother caught me...
JERRY:	Caught you? Doing what?
GEORGE:	You know. I was alone…
ELAINE:	You mean…?
GEORGE:	[nodding] Uh-huh.
KRAMER:	[laughing] She caught you?
JERRY:	Where?
GEORGE:	I stopped by the house to drop the car off, and I went inside for a few minutes.. Nobody was there - they're supposed to be working. My mother had a Glamour magazine, I started leafing through it.
JERRY:	Glamour?
GEORGE:	..So, one thing lead to another..
JERRY:	So, what did she do?
GEORGE:	First she screams, "George, what are you doing?! My God!" And it looked like she was gonna faint - she started clutching the wall, trying to hang onto it.
KRMAER:	Man…
GEORGE:	I didn't know whether to try and keep her from falling, or zip up.
JERRY:	What did you do?
GEORGE:	I zipped up!
ELAINE:	[wide-eyed] So, she fell?
GEORGE:	Yeah. [defensively] Well, I couldn't run over there the way I was!
ELAINE:	No, I guess you couldn't have..
JERRY:	No, I wouldn't think so.
ELAINE:	…done that.
GEORGE:	So, she fell, and then she started screaming, "My back! My back!" So, I picked her up and took her to the hospital.
ELAINE:	[between chuckles] How is she?
GEORGE:	[somewhat angered] She's in traction.
ELAINE:	[still laughing] Ok, I'm sorry.
GEORGE:	It's not funny, Elaine.
ELAINE:	[stifling laughter] I know. I'm sorry. I'm serious.
GEORGE:	Her back went out. She's gotta be there for a couple of days. All she said on the way over in the car was, "Why, George, why?!" I said, "Because it's there!"
JERRY:	Glamour?
GEORGE:	[vowing] Well, I'll tell you this, though - I am never doing.. THAT , again.
ELAINE:	What, you mean, in your mother's house, or all together?
GEORGE:	 All together.
ELAINE:	Oh, gimme a break… 
JERRY:	[skeptical] Ohhh yeah… right.
KRAMER:	Oh, like you're gonna stop?
JERRY: C’mon.
ELAINE:	C'mon…
GEORGE:	You don't think I can?
JERRY:	No chance.
GEORGE:	(daring) You think you could?
JERRY:	Well, I know I could hold out longer than you.
GEORGE:	Care to make it interesting?
JERRY:	Sure, how much?
GEORGE:	A hundred dollars.
JERRY:	[pointing] You're on.
KRAMER:	Wait a second, wait a second. Count me in on this. (clicks his tongue)
JERRY:	You?
KRAMER:	Yeah.
JERRY:	You'll be out before we get the check.
ELAINE:	[smiling] I want to be in on this, too.
GEORGE: Oh, no.
JERRY: Ohh, no. No, no, no… 
ELAINE:	Why?
JERRY:	It's apples and oranges..
ELAINE:	What? Why?
GEORGE AND JERRY:	No, no, no, no...
ELAINE:	Why?
JERRY:	Because you're a woman!
ELAINE:	So what?
JERRY:	It's easier for a woman not to do it than a man.
ELAINE:	[sarcastic] Oh.
JERRY:	We have to do it. It's part of our lifestyle. It's like, uh.. shaving.
ELAINE:	Oh, that is such bologna. I shave my legs.
KRAMER:	Not everyday.
GEORGE:	Alright, look, you want to be in?
ELAINE:	Yeah!
GEORGE:	You gotta give us odds. At least two to one - you gotta put up two-hundred dollars.
KRAMER:	No... a thousand!
ELAINE:	No, I'll - I'll put up one-fifty.
GEORGE:	Alright, you're in for one-fifty.
JERRY:	[nodding] Okay, one-fifty.
GEORGE:	Alright, now, how are we gonna monitor this thing?
JERRY:	Well, obviously, we all know each other very well, I'm sure that we'll all feel comfortable within the confines of the honor system. 
KRAMER:	Alright.
 

GEORGE:	...No, ma, I'm not gonna see a psychiatrist... I don't care if you do pay for it! No! Discussion over. Yeah, alright, I'll see you later. Yes, of course I'm gonna come by. Alright.
My mother wants me to see a psychiatrist now. Why?! Because she caught me? [scoffs] You know, if everyone who did that had to go see a psychiatrist… [laughing, he snorts]
JERRY:	…Yeah?
GEORGE:	[defensively] Whatever.
JERRY:	How is she?
GEORGE:	[shrugging it off] She'll be fine. I gotta go to the hospital to see her tonight.
JERRY:	Yeah?
ELAINE:	It's me.
JERRY:	Come on up.
GEORGE:	Hey, what are you doing tonight?
JERRY:	Dating Marla.
GEORGE:	Oh, the virgin?
JERRY:	Yeah.
GEORGE:	Any, uh.. progress, there? What's the latest?
JERRY:	Well, I got my troops amassed along the border - I'm just waiting for someone to give me the go-ahead.

KRAMER:	Hey, look at this, c'mere. There's a naked woman across the street.

JERRY:	Where?
KRAMER:	Second floor from the top. See the window on the left?
GEORGE:	[in awe] Wow!
JERRY:	[also amazed] Who walks around the house like that?!
GEORGE: Maybe she's a nudist. You know, those nudist colony people..
KRAMER:	Yeah… [pause] yeah…
 	
JERRY:	Hey, let me ask you a question. In these nudist colonies, do they eat naked in the dining room?
GEORGE:	I would imagine it's all naked.
JERRY:	What about the chamber maids? Are they naked, too?
GEORGE:	 They're naked, the gardeners naked.. the bellhops. One big nude-a-rama.
ELAINE:	Hey.
JERRY: Hey. 
GEORGE: Hey.
ELAINE:	Well, [smiling] where's my money? Who caved?
JERRY: Not me.
GEORGE: Not me.
ELAINE:	What're you looking at?
JERRY:	There's a naked woman across the street.
ELAINE:	[smiling, chuckling] This is gonna be the easiest money I've ever made in my life. So, my friend, Joyce, is teaching an aerobics class. I'm gonna go tonight.
JERRY:	[commenting] Yeah.. the-the waitress should've taken it back.
ELAINE:	So then, I got a call this morning. You know, I was, uh, chosen to go on the space shuttle. We're goin to Mars.
JERRY: Uh-huh.
GEORGE:	Have a good time.

KRAMER:	I'm out!

ELAINE:	What?!
KRAMER:	Yeah, I'm out... I'm out of the contest.
GEORGE:	You're out?!
KRAMER:	Yeah, yeah… what?
ELAINE:	Well, that was fast!
KRAMER:	Well, it was that woman across the street. You know, you better be careful, buddy. She's gonna get you next. ELAINE:	..And then there were three.
 

JOYCE:	So, when was the last time you took a class?
ELAINE:	Oh, it's been a while.
JOYCE:	(overly excited) Are you psyched?
ELAINE:	[fake excitement] Yeah. yeah, I'm really… psyched.
JOYCE:	Well, you're gonna thank me for getting you in here.
ELAINE:	Why is that?
JOYCE:	(pointing, she directs Elaine's attention off-camera) See the guy with the dark hair and the red shorts?
ELAINE:	Oh, my God. John F. Kennedy Junior's here?!
JOYCE:	He's gonna be in your class today.
ELAINE:	In my class? John Kennedy's gonna be in my class?!
JOYCE:	I can get you a spot right behind him. He has got a great butt.
ELAINE:	Yeah. Butt. Butt. Great butt. John-John's butt.
 
MARLA:	Let's slow it down a little.
JERRY:	Slow it down?
MARLA:	Well, you know..
JERRY:	Ah, yeah… I know.
MARLA:	You're okay with that, right?
JERRY:	Yeah, yeah… of course. What, do you think I care about the sex? What kind of person do you think I am? That doesn't mean anything to me. [faint] I don't care about that.
MARLA:	So, I'll see you Saturday night, then?
JERRY:	[smiling, nodding] Sure, Saturday night.
MARLA:	Alright, then. Good night.
JERRY:	Goodnight. Not just a good night... a great night.
 


KRAMER:	[singing] Goood Moorrrnninng!
JERRY:	[out of it] Yeah, good morning.
KRAMER:	Ha, ha! Nothing like some good solid sack time.
JERRY:	She's not there. She's doin' her wash.
KRAMER:	Oh. So, did you make it through the night?
JERRY:	Yes, I'm proud to say I did!
KRAMER:	So, you're still master of your domain.
JERRY:	[nodding] Yes. Yes I am. Master of my domain. But I will tell you this... I am going over to her apartment, and I'm tellin' her to put those shades down!
KRAMER:	Whoa, whoa, whoa. What-what did you just say?
JERRY:	I can't take it anymore! She's driving me crazy! I can't sleep, I can't leave the house, and I' here, I'm climbin' the walls. Meanwhile, I'm dating a virgin, I'm in this contest - something's gotta give!
KRAMER:	Do you hear what you're saying?! Can you hear it?! This is a beautiful woman walking around naked, and you want to tell her to stop?! That's the dumbest thing I ever heard! I mean, think comprehends- I'm not gonna let you do it.
JERRY:[persistent] Well, I'm doin' it, get out of my way.
KRAMER: No, no, no, no. You can't! You can't! This is something that comes about once in a lifetime! When we were boys, looking through our bedroom windows, we would think... "Why can't there be a woman out there, taking her clothes off?" And now that wish's come true, and you want to *Pffft* throw it away?!
JERRY:	Look, I'm sorry...
KRAMER:	No, I'm not gonna let you do it, Jerry.
JERRY:	Kramer, get outta my way!
KRAMER:	[frantic] No, no, no. Don't do it. Don't do it! For my sake! God knows I don't ask you for much! [pleading] Now, come on. Please, Jerry. Please! I'm beggin ya! Please! [claps hands] Come on! Please!
JERRY:	Alright.. 
KRAMER:	Yes!
JERRY:	…Alright.
KRAMER:	Thank you, thank you, thank you.
JERRY:	She's not there!
KRAMER:	Oh, I can wait..
 

JERRY:	So the nurse was giving her a sponge bath?
GEORGE:	Every night at six-thirty. The nurse was gorgeous.. then I got a look at the patient.. [laughs, then snorts] I was going nuts.
JERRY:	Oh, man. Well, I guess you'll be going back to that hospital.
GEORGE:	[fake sympathy] Well, my mother, Jerry..
JERRY:	But are you still master of your domain?
GEORGE:	I am king of the county. You?
JERRY:	Lord of the manor.
(Elaine enters and sits next to Jerry)
ELAINE:	John F. Kennedy Jooon-ya.....
JERRY:	What?
ELAINE:	[smiling] He was in my aerobics class.
JERRY:	Really? Did you talk to him?
ELAINE:	No, you don't understand - he was working out right in front of me. So, listen, after the class was over, I timed my walk to the door so we'd get there at the exact same moment, and he says to me, (thinking the world of what he said) "Quite a workout."
GEORGE:	Quite a workout? What did you say?
ELAINE:	[smiling] I said, "yeah."
JERRY:	[fake praise] Good one.
ELAINE:	So then, listen, listen. So then, I showered and I dressed, and I saw him again, on the way out. [giddy] So we're walki' and talkin, and he asked me my name - and I think I said Elaine - but, I mean, who the hell knows.. And so then, he says to me: Do you wanna split a cab uptown? And I said, "Sure" - even though I was going downtown. So, we get in the cab, and I mean, I have no idea where I'm goin, right? But this is John F. Kennedy Junior we're talkin about! [deep breath] So, then, he says to me, "Where do you live?" And I - and I - and I was close to your block, so I said your building. So he dropped me off in front, [laughs] and I had to take a cab all the way back downtown to my house… Oh, God…
JERRY:	But the question is, are you still master of your domain?
ELAINE:	[sets glass down] I'm queen of the castle. 
 
JOYCE:	Hi!
ELAINE:	Hi.
JOYCE:	Did you get your hair done today?
ELAINE:	No, I just, uh, fixed it.. a little bit.
JOYCE:	"You know who" isn't here. He was in the early class today. But I think you made quite an impression on him yesterday.
ELAINE:	What? What? Who? Me-me-me? I made an impression? What impression?
JOYCE:	Let me just put this back. 
ELAINE:	No! No! Now! Tell me now! What did he say?!
JOYCE:	(uneasy) He asked about you.
ELAINE:	[ecstatically] He asked about me? John Kennedy asked about me?! (hangs off the side of the counter, both feet in the air) What did he say?
JOYCE:	He wanted to know your situation.
ELAINE:	[quickly] What situation? I have a situation?
JOYCE:	I-I told him you were single.
ELAINE:	[smiling] That was good... That was very good.
JOYCE:	He said you were just his type.
ELAINE:	Okay, you tryin to hurt me? Are you tryin to hurt - you're tryin to injure me, right? You're trying to hurt me.
JOYCE:	He also told me to tell you that he'll be in your neighborhood tomorrow around nine o' clock.  So he's gonna stop in front of your building if you want to come down and say hello.
JERRY:	Alright, Ma, I'll talk to you later... Nothing, I'm, I'm watching, uh, Tiny Toons here, on Nickelodeon... It's, I-I like kid shows. They have a very innocent, wholesome quality...
KRAMER:	 Oh, that's good. That's good. That's very, very good. Oh, it's hot in there..
KRAMER:	 It's hot in there. So, just walk around a little bit. Don't be ashamed, don't be ashamed… that's good, that's good… yes, yes, yes…
JERRY:	[singing] The wheels on the bus go round and round, round and round, round and round. The wheels on the bus… 
(Kramer joins in with Jerry, only, he has a different version)
KRAMER:	The woman across the street has nothing on, nothing on, nothing on… 

JERRY:	I don't keep real coffee in here, I get my coffee on the outside! 
GEORGE:	All you got is instant coffee? Why don't you get some real coffee?
JERRY:	[shouting] Come on up!
GEORGE:	Where did you get those socks?
JERRY:	I don't know.
GEORGE:	I think those are my socks!
JERRY:	How are these your socks?!
GEORGE:	I don't know, but those are my socks! I had a pair just like that with the blue stripe, and now I don't have them anymore!
JERRY:	[sarcastic] Oh, yeah, that's right, well, you fell asleep one day on the sofa and I took them off your stinkin' feet. They looked so good to me, I just had to have them!
GEORGE:	Yeah, well, they're my socks!
JERRY:	They're my socks!
(a brief moment passes as they look at each other)
GEORGE:	Oh boy..
JERRY:	What are we doing here..
GEORGE:	…oh boy.
JERRY:	This is ridiculous.
GEORGE:	Do you believe this? We're fighting. We're fighting.
JERRY:	I haven't been myself lately. I've been snapping at everybody.
GEORGE:	Me too. I've been yelling at strangers on the street.
ELAINE:	Hello…
GEORGE:	[shocked] You caved?!
JERRY:	It's over?
GEORGE:	You're out?
JERRY:	Ohh-my-God. The Queen is dead.
GEORGE:	I figured you'd cruise. At least through the Spring.
JERRY:	What happened?
ELAINE:	It was..uh.. John-John.
JERRY: Ohhhhh.. John-John.
GEORGE:	Ohhhhh.. John-John.
JERRY:	But you made it through the day before.
ELAINE:	Yeah, but yesterday, he told Joyce, the aerobics teacher, that he wants to meet me outside here at nine o' clock tonight.
JERRY:	Why outside here?
ELAINE:	Because he think I live here. Remember when we shared a cab, and he dropped me off out in front? He's picking me up.
JERRY:	Alright, Costanza - it's just you and me.
GEORGE:	And then, [smacks the money] there were two.
ELAINE:	[to herself slowly] Elaine Benes Kennedy Junior..
 
MARLA:	[eagerly] Let's go in the bedroom.
JERRY:	Really?
MARLA:	Yes.
JERRY:	You sure?
MARLA:	Yes.
JERRY:	You really want to?
MARLA:	I do. I'm ready.
JERRY:	Okay..
MARLA:	I know how difficult this must have been for you.
JERRY:	[chuckles] You don't know the half of it.

MARLA:	What do you mean?
JERRY:	Well, it's kinda silly, but..

MARLA:	 Contest?! A contest! This is what you do with your friends?
JERRY:	No, it was just a bet. I mean, it actually started with George and his mother-
MARLA:	I don't want to hear another word. And to think how close I came to you being the one! I must have been out of my mind.
ELAINE:	Marla? Hi, oh, I'm glad I ran into you-
MARLA:	I don't want to have anything to do with you or your perverted friends. oohh, get away from me! You're horrible. Horrible! All of you!
 
ELAINE:	What happened?
JERRY:	I told her about the contest.
ELAINE:	Ohh. Boy, she's a whack-o.
(George enters)
GEORGE:	(to Elaine) Hey, what happened?
ELAINE:	What?
GEORGE:	I thought you were meeting Kennedy.
ELAINE:	[let down] He didn't show.
GEORGE:	Yeah, he did.
ELAINE:	What? He's - He's out there? Oh, my God. I-I gotta go, I gotta go..
GEORGE:	No, no, no. He just left.
ELAINE:	What?
GEORGE:	Yeah, he was talking to Marla.
JERRY:	Marla?
GEORGE:	Yeah, I think, you know, she was, like, crying, and he was consoling her, and then, she, uh, just got into his car, and they just drove away.
ELAINE:	[angered] He left with Marla, the virgin?
GEORGE:	Yeah.
ELAINE:	They drove away?
GEORGE:	Yeah, drove away.. You know, I said 'Hello' to him. You know, he's - he's-
JERRY:	[shocked] Oh my God in heaven!
ELAINE:	[sound of surprise] Is that..?
GEORGE:	Kramer?!
ELAINE:	He's waving..
