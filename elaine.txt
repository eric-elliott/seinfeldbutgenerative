Hey. Hi Sheila. Okay. We ready to go? Boy, I'm in the mood for a cheeseburger. What soup place? Stunned by soup? Huh. All right. Come on. Why? What happens if you don't order right? What? What? Oh, boy, I'm really scared! All right. Jerry, that's enough now about the soup nazi. Whoa! Wow! Look at this. You know what this is? This is an antique armoire. Wow! It's French. Armoire. How much is this? FURNITURE Huh? Ha. 200. You know, I've always wanted one of these things. Yeah. All right. You guys go ahead. I'm getting an armoire, Jerry. What do you mean I can't bring in here? I live here. But I didn't know, Tom. I g -- can't you just make an exception? Please. I've got a nice face. Ohh! Well, you're just gonna have to hold this for me. FURNITURE Oh, no...please don't go. Please - please don't walk away. Oh, Kramer! Thank God. I really appreciate you doing this. Do you need anything? Mulligatawny? Oh! Who? The soup nazi? All right. I'll be back. Oh, no. No. No. No. I got it. Hey, I got it. Hey. Didn't you already get soup? Why? What happened? [laughing] Yeah. No. Listen, George, I am quite certain I'm walking out of there with a bowl of soup. Oh, I know! It is awful! I don't know. Ohh! Ohh! Stop it! I know. Ugh! You know, we should say something. I mean, why does he do that? Doesn't he know what a huge turnoff that is? Yeah. No. Me neither. Oh, God! Hi there. Um, uh -- [drumming on countertop] Oh! Oh! Oh! One mulligatawny and, um.... what is that right there? Is that lima bean? Never been a big fan. [coughing] Um..you know what? Has anyone ever told you you look exactly like Al Pacino? You know, " Scent Of A Woman." Who-ah! Who-ah! Well, I -- Hmmm? What? I mean, is he allowed to do this? It's discrimination! I'm gonna call the states' attorney office. I really am. All right. All right. Give me a tsate. Mmm! Oh God, I gotta sit down. What happened? Where's my armoire? Wha--? Street toughs took my armoire? I can't believe this! Wha -- the soup nazi threw me out. So, essentially, you chose soup over a woman? Yeah. You know what I just realized? Suddenly, George has become much more normal than you. Yeah. Come on. I mean, think about it. He's engaged to be married. Your top priority is soup. Yeah. All right. You made the right decision. Hey. There he is. Yeah. I know. Me, too. No. In what way? I don't think George has ever thought he's better than anybody. Hello. One of these days that guy is gonna get his. [gasps] Oh! Oh, I love it! I absolutely love it! The K Man did it! [laughing] How much did you pay for this thing? What? What? Who's was it? Where'd you get it? Get out! [Elaine pushes on Kramer's chest, causing in to fall backwards through her swinging door] The soup nazi gave it to you? Why? [gasps] Well, I'm just gonna go down there and personally thank him. I mean, I had this guy all wrong. This is wonderful! Hi. You know, Kramer gave me the armoire and it is so beautiful. I'm mean, I just can't tell you how much I appreciate it. I mean, you know, I've never been so insulted in my entire life. There's something really wrong with this man. He is a soup nazi. What? What is that? Let me see this. [gasps] You know what this is? This is a recipe for soup, and look at this. There are like thirty different recipes. These are his recipes! So? So, his secret's out. Don't you see? I could give these to every restaurant in town. I could have 'em published! I could - I could drop fliers from a plane above the city. What do you care? Get out of my way, Jerry. Don't make me hurt you, Jerry. Hello. I don't want soup. I can make my own soup. “Five cups chopped Porcine mushrooms, half a cup of olive oil, 3 pounds celery." Yeah, that's right. I got 'em all. Cold cucumber, corn and crab chowder, mulligatawny. You're through soup nazi. Pack it up. No more soup for you. Next! Hey, I didn't get one either. This is what people do. So we took a little ride. What's the big deal? What do you do? Who? Isn't it going the other way? But it's Saturday. What's the matter? Oh she's fat? What? JERRY Where's the car? I didn't pay attention. I'm sure it's right around here. It's black, right? How long can fish live in one of these plastic bags? You'd better find this car. There it is!...No that's not it. Hey, watch it. ...Did you see that car? Maniac. Can you explain something to me? I got six questions wrong on my drivers test. That's the maximum. I read the book, I'm a college graduate. This is a country where fifty percent of its high school students can't locate Europe on a map. How are they all passing that test? It's a mystery. Those school zones are a killer. I think they're laboring. Why are they using so many colors? And the numbers go up to forty. It felt like a couple of levels. Look at that woman. He's got it. Jerry, look at my fish. My fish are dying right in front of me! We have to get someone to drive us around the parking lot to help us look for the car. Excuse me, we can't seem to find our car. I was wondering if it would be possible if you're not in a hurry, to drive us around the garage for five minutes so we can look. Five minutes. We're not wilding. Excuse me - I can't seem to find my car - do you think you could drive me... Oh that's funny? Is that funny? Well tell me if you think this is funny: These fish are dying! They're gasping for oxygen right now! They'll be floating in an hour. Is that funny too? Excuse me... Sorry to have disturbed you. Terribly sorry. But the fish will be dead. You do know that. They can't live in plastic. That's not me talking, that's science. Jerry! Maybe he went to one of the other levels. I'll go look for him. No, no, I'll be back. And now he's gone. I'm sure he's looking for the car. Five minutes, that's all. I just want to find him. But why? Why can't you do it? No, see that's not a reason you can't. You just don't want to. But why? Why don't you want to? But wouldn't you get any satisfaction out of helping someone out? Jerry! Jerry! You what? Look at my fish... Is he... Please, we can't find our car. Please drive us around the parking lot to find our car. My fish are dying. I can see not caring what happens to us, we're human. But what about the fish? The fish? That's right, go. Go home to your dumbbells. Work on your pecs. I'm really impressed. That's right you heard me. You got a problem with that? I thought he was with you. Have we looked over there? Have we checked that side? We didn't come in over there! Hi, I'm Elaine. It's very nice of you to do this. I've asked several people and they wouldn't even answer me. What about my fish? I'll say. What is it? The car! We found it. I can't believe it! Okay, well, he had this idea of a pizza place where you make your own pie! What's that? Yep. Yeah.. Oh? Oh, a puffy shirt. Uh, Jerry's going to be on the "Today" show on Friday. Yep.. yep. Um, he's promoting a benefit for Goodwill, you know, they, uh, they clothe the poor, and the homeless… And the indigent, yeah.. I, I do volunteer work for them. I-I set the whole thing up, and I got Jerry to do it. Ohh, yeah. Yeah.. yep. Yep. Mmm Why don't you want to take a civil service test? Hi, Kramer. Guess what - I just saw Bryant Gumbel, he said he might help out at the benefit! What is that?! Why're you wearing that now? When did she, when did she ask you this? I didn't hear anything. Well, you can't wear that on the show. Wha- What? No. Jerry, you are promoting a benefit to clothe homeless people. You can't come out dressed like that! You're all puffed up! You look like the Count of Monte Cristo! Yeah, but you're supposed to be a compassionate person! That cares about poor people! You look like you're gonna… swing in on a chandelier! Hey, I've never noticed your hands before. Let me see. Yeah, real nice. You ready? I'm sorry. Well, it got me fired from the benefit committee. So... Whatley's still Jewish, huh? [shrugging it off] eh. This place is like Studio 54 with a menorah. Oh… I got denim vest checking me out. [laughs] Fake phone number's coming out tonight. Mm-hmm. No, please! Denim vest! He's smoothing it! Jerry! God! Nice vest. I like the... big metal buttons Why don't I give you my phone number? Hey! Oh, nothing for me. I'm going to "Atomic Sub" later. I got a card, and they stamp it every time I buy a sub. 24 stamps, and I become a submarine [makes a gesture] captain. [embarrassed] Free sub. What? What is it? "Dear son, Happy Festivus." What is Festivus? Ohh… and another piece of the puzzle falls into place. Oh, I can't believe it! I've lost my "Atomic Sub" card!.. Oh no! I bet I wrote that fake number on the back of it when I gave it to denim vest! I've eaten 23 bad subs, I just need 1 more! It's like a long, bad movie, but you want to see the end of it! Alright, then, it's like a boring book, but you gotta finish it. [irritated] want that free sub. That's a good idea. Worked? Oh, I remember seeing those guys picketing out there, but I haven't seen them in a long time. What were your.. demands? I believe that's the new minimum wage. So, anyway, I've been giving out your number as my standard fake. So, listen, when this guy calls, if you could just give him my real number.. Oh... my… My number? Ohh… Okay… Uh, well, there you go. And, uh, tell you what… put a sawbuck on Captain Nemo in the third at Belmont. Happy Festivus, Georgie. Kramer, listen, I got a little phone relay going, so, if a guy calls H&H and he's looking for me, you take a message. Hey! I have spent a lot of time, and I have eaten a lot of crap to get to where I am today. And I am NOT throwing it all away now. Maybe. Hello, Frank. Kramer! Kramer.. any word from the vest? No, I got to stay here and wait for the call. No, I just... I want the one that I earned. [Phone rings] I'll get it. I'll get it! [Into phone] H&H, and Elaine. What did you do? Oh, hi! Kramer, the vest just called. Oh, yeah, I got a little steam bath. Listen, in 10 minutes, I'm gonna have my hands on that "Atomic Sub" card. Free sub. I'll see ya. Steve. It's Elaine. Yeah. I see you're still sticking with the denim. (He's wearing a denim coat) Do you have that card that I gave you? No, no, no. You give me your number. No. DENIM No. A fake number! Blimey! I didn't have time to go home. What are you doing here? What are you doing here? Hey, I was in a shvitz for 6 hours. Give me a break. Hey, how'd my horse do? Well did he bring it up in the meeting? Yeah, I'm on the phone here. No thanks. Yeah, yeah I'll hold. Why don't you just let Golden Boy soak in the sink with some Woolight? Yeah. Oh! What? He is! Oh! that’s fantastic! I'm so excited! Yes I'm excited, OK, OK I'll be in soon! yeah, yeah, I'm coming, I'm coming! OK bye. Yuri Testikov, the Russian writer! Yeah! Pendant's publishing his new book, and I'm working on it! Lippman and I are gonna go to the airport on Thursday and pick him up in a limousine! Oh! [pushing Jerry] Do you know what this means, it's like working with Tolstoy! …ha ha ha. But it's a line from that song! Really? What is this your mail? Oh! Your Alumni Magazine. [gasps] Hey Jerry, you're in the Alumni magazine! Listen to this: Jerry Seinfeld has appeared on "David Letterman" and the "Tonight Show" and he did a pilot for NBC called "Jerry" ...that was not picked up. Georgie, how come there’s not anything about you in here? All right… this is too much fun, I gotta get back to work. Yeah. [startled] It’s OK. What? Wha...? Wow! Oh! I can't believe this, Kramer! I've been wanting to get one of these things! Are you sure that... …are you sure you can't use this thing? Where'd you get this? Ohh, that is so true! Although one wonders if "War and Peace" would has been as highly acclaimed as it was, had it was published under it's original title "War---What Is It Good For?" Yeah. Mr. Lippman. It was his mistress who insisted that he call it… "War and Peace." "War--What Is It Good For." [sings] Absolutely nothin' HUH! Say it Again! That's a song… …they-they took it from Tolstoy. No it’s not. That really is true. Yes it is… Oh, I… Oh… It must be my new organizer. Right, I think it’s this… OK. I don’t quite know… Yeah, I’m gonna work on that… Hey, "great" organizer you gave me. It wouldn't stop beeping, in the car so Testikov, through it out the window. I transferred everything in there. I threw out my old book. I'm lost now, Kramer. What, what is it? OK I'll see you later. There you are! So? So what do you have to say for yourself? "War-- What is it good for?"! A-hu hu hu hu. Yuri Testikov, the Russian writer! Hellooo! Uh-hu. And do you know what happened? Oh, Please. What, how did you know that? [gasps] How did you find it? [gasps] Where is it, give it to me! Why not. But I didn't do it. Testikov did it, he should pay for it! One million. Yeah, 308. Oh, I'm crazy for doing this! Why are you so interested -- you want to take her out? Well, you're not Superman. Oh. Listen, you got the tape-recorder. Yeah I gotta get him on tape. If this woman ends up in the "New England Journal Of Medicine" I'm not gonna pay for it. Hi, [sighs] you got the organizer? Um, yes this is my friend Jerry. Um, he accompanied me, ya know [clears throat], single women in a big city can be dangerous, so… Hmm. [nods] [quietly] Ok. Uh-oh-ah, by the way, do you remember the other day when we were in the limo and ah, my organizer started making noise and you threw it out the window? [laughs] Well um, would you believe that it actually, hit somebody in the head. Boing! Hehe hehe. Oh that’s nothing. Um and anyway um… No, no that's my purse! No, get-get off my purse! No that's… radio! George I’ve just reading this thing in the paper, it's unbelievable! What, are you in a bad mood? Ohhh! Golden Boy? I'm sorry. (pats him on the arm) Mm-hm. [smiling] Who, me? They have to, it's in the Geneva Convention. Hi. You mean…? [wide-eyed] So, she fell? No, I guess you couldn't have.. …done that. [between chuckles] How is she? [still laughing] Ok, I'm sorry. [stifling laughter] I know. I'm sorry. I'm serious. What, you mean, in your mother's house, or all together? Oh, gimme a break… C'mon… [smiling] I want to be in on this, too. Why? What? Why? GEORGE AND Why? So what? [sarcastic] Oh. Oh, that is such bologna. I shave my legs. Yeah! No, I'll - I'll put up one-fifty. It's me. Hey. Well, [smiling] where's my money? Who caved? What're you looking at? [smiling, chuckling] This is gonna be the easiest money I've ever made in my life. So, my friend, Joyce, is teaching an aerobics class. I'm gonna go tonight. So then, I got a call this morning. You know, I was, uh, chosen to go on the space shuttle. We're goin to Mars. What?! Well, that was fast! ..And then there were three. Oh, it's been a while. [fake excitement] Yeah. yeah, I'm really… psyched. Why is that? Oh, my God. John F. Kennedy Junior's here?! In my class? John Kennedy's gonna be in my class?! Yeah. Butt. Butt. Great butt. John-John's butt. John F. Kennedy Jooon-ya..... [smiling] He was in my aerobics class. No, you don't understand - he was working out right in front of me. So, listen, after the class was over, I timed my walk to the door so we'd get there at the exact same moment, and he says to me, (thinking the world of what he said) "Quite a workout." [smiling] I said, "yeah." So then, listen, listen. So then, I showered and I dressed, and I saw him again, on the way out. [giddy] So we're walki' and talkin, and he asked me my name - and I think I said Elaine - but, I mean, who the hell knows.. And so then, he says to me: Do you wanna split a cab uptown? And I said, "Sure" - even though I was going downtown. So, we get in the cab, and I mean, I have no idea where I'm goin, right? But this is John F. Kennedy Junior we're talkin about! [deep breath] So, then, he says to me, "Where do you live?" And I - and I - and I was close to your block, so I said your building. So he dropped me off in front, [laughs] and I had to take a cab all the way back downtown to my house… Oh, God… [sets glass down] I'm queen of the castle. Hi. No, I just, uh, fixed it.. a little bit. What? What? Who? Me-me-me? I made an impression? What impression? No! No! Now! Tell me now! What did he say?! [ecstatically] He asked about me? John Kennedy asked about me?! (hangs off the side of the counter, both feet in the air) What did he say? [quickly] What situation? I have a situation? [smiling] That was good... That was very good. Okay, you tryin to hurt me? Are you tryin to hurt - you're tryin to injure me, right? You're trying to hurt me. Hello… It was..uh.. John-John. Yeah, but yesterday, he told Joyce, the aerobics teacher, that he wants to meet me outside here at nine o' clock tonight. Because he think I live here. Remember when we shared a cab, and he dropped me off out in front? He's picking me up. [to herself slowly] Elaine Benes Kennedy Junior.. Marla? Hi, oh, I'm glad I ran into you- What happened? Ohh. Boy, she's a whack-o. (George enters) What? [let down] He didn't show. What? He's - He's out there? Oh, my God. I-I gotta go, I gotta go.. What? [angered] He left with Marla, the virgin? They drove away? [sound of surprise] Is that..? He's waving..
