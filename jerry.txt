Which one you wanna go to shmoopy? You're a shmoopy! You're a shmoopy! Uh,..we'll go to 3rd Avenue. So, can you come with us for lunch to the soup place? All right, then. I'll see you later. Bye shmoopy. No. We gotta go to the soup place. He's always raving. I finally got a chance to go there the other day, and I tell you this, you will be stunned. You can't eat this soup standing up, your knees buckle. There's only one caveat -- the guy who runs the place is a little temperamental, especially about the ordering procedure. He's secretly referred to as the soup nazi. He yells and you don't get your soup. Just follow the ordering procedure and you will be fine. All right. As you walk in the place move immediately to your right. The main thing is to keep the line moving. Right. It's very important not to embellish on your order. No extraneous comments. No questions. No compliments. Elaine. Ar-moire. He gave you the nice face discount. What about the soup? [in French accent] Pardon. It's like this all the time. Oh, no. It is. Just be still. Hard to believe. Shhhhh! All right, Bania, I - I'm not letting you cut in line. Because if he catches us, we'll never be able to get soup again. Medium crab bisque. Just forget it. Let it go. Oh, man. Ohh! This is fantastic. How does he do it? I gave you a taste. What do you want? I told you not to say anything. You can't go in there, brazenly flaunt the rules and then think I'm gonna share with you! I'm sorry. This is what comes from living under a Nazi regime. Hi shmoopy. You're a shmoopy! Hey, listen, so we'll meet you and Susan at the movie tonight? Why? Just like that? Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Wha -- what are you doing? Well, sit on one of your couch cushions. What are you gonna get? You better decide, sister. You're on deck. Sheila! Uh-oh. Do I know you? It was a bisque. Really? Have you tastes the soup? See, the way I figure it, it's much easier to patch things up with Sheila than with the soup nazi. Hey. Oh, thanks. So, did these thieves want any money? They just wanted the armoire? Yeah? Hey, have you noticed George is acting a little strange lately? I don't know. A lot of attitude, like he's better than me, or something. Hello. Absolutely not. Aw, we didn't go. Sheila and I are kind of on the outs. Yeah. Wha - wha - what are you, happy? I don't know, but you look like you're happy. You can't fool me. Don't insult me, George because I know when you're happy. Is that so? Disgusting? Well, I guess I have all the more reason to get back with her. What? You're still with the pact? All I did was shake your hand. It was stupid of me. No. I know. I - I was really sort of half-kidding. What about that Bavarian cream pie joke I told you? There's no truth to that. Nobody with a terminal illness goes from the United States to Europe for a piece of Bavarian cream pie and then when they get there and they don't have it he says " Aw, I'll just have some coffee." There's no truth to that. So, am I forgiven, shmoopy? Aw! Oh, hi Susan, George. You remember Sheila. Yeah. That's right. You got a problem? Well, we're changing the rules. What about you, shmoopy? How 'bout a little tuna? You want a little tuna fishy? Yum yum little tuna fishy? I'm heading over to Elaine's. Those two? Are you sure? Well, let's confront 'em. There's no cops around. They're gonna leave. Come on. Let's go. I don't know. " 5 cups chopped Porcine mushrooms, half a cup of olive oil, 3 pounds of celery, chopped parsley..." Wait a second, Elaine. Where do you think you're going? Elaine, I don't want you causing any trouble down at that soup stand. I happen to love that soup. Elaine, let the man make his soup! Well. Well. Hey, Susan, George. Oh, really? Because we're kind of not seeing each other anymore. Yeah. Well, she was very affectionate - which I love. You know I love that - but mentally, we couldn't quite make the connection. Yeah. Too bad, 'cause you gotta have the affection - which you obviously have. I think it's great that you're so open with your affections in public. See, we had that. Oh, yeah. But the mental thing. But anyway. I'll see ya. What is it? Wha - wha - what's the matter? Well, where are you going? Why do I always have the feeling that everybody's doing something better than me on Saturday afternoons? No they don't. They're out on some big picnic. They're cooking burgers. They're making out on blankets. They're not at some mall in Jersey watching their friends trying to find the world's cheapest air-conditioner. Big accomplishment. Five o'clock. You're not late. Of course we'll hit traffic. It's rush hour. There is no other way in New York. Everybody goes every way all the time. You got the picnic and burger traffic. I have to go to the bathroom. Why do they hide the bathroom in these malls? You want me to help you with that? What do you think, Georgie boy? I thought it was green. I remember seeing green. It's over there. I know where it is. There it is! No, no that's a Toyota. Hmmm...I thought it was... I thought it was over there. I really have to go to the bathroom. I'll wait. Alright. Maybe I should just go anytime I get the urge like you...wherever I am. There's too much urinary freedom in this society. I'm proud to hold it in. It builds character. Will you let me help you with that? You're not worried somebody's gonna pee on it? Parents never forget a foul-up. I once left a jacket on the bus when I was fourteen. Last week I'm flying to Chicago to do a show, "Make sure you hang on to your jacket." Maybe it's not on this level. There are four different levels. Maybe we're on the wrong level. How long was the escalator ride up? You should always carry a pad and pen. Where was the bathroom in this mall? There are six-hundred stores, I didn't see one bathroom. What is this, like a joke? They finished building the mall and they go, "Oh my god, we forgot the bathrooms." All right, that's it. From now on no more calling out they found it, unless we're sitting in it. Okay? His eyes look a little cloudy. Who's got the tickets? I thought you knew this mall. You said you'd been here before! No one's going to do that. Those are really ugly sneakers. Where did you get those? It's amazing how shopping makes me have to go. All I have to do is walk into a department store and it's like some kind of horse laxative just kicked in. I know. No I can't. You think I'm too cautious? Organic. So's Buddy Hackett. He's a comedian. All right. All right. I can manage. Okay, okay. I'll be right back. But... ...Kramer I've had this condition since I was eleven! I've been in and out of hospitals my whole life. I have no control over it. Doctors have told me that when I feel it, the best thing to do is just release it. Otherwise, I could die. Do you hear what I'm saying to you?! I'm telling you that if I don't go, I could die. Die. Is it worth dying for? So you don't care if I die. It was life and death. Oh I'm lying. Why would I do it unless I was in mortal danger? I know it's against the law. Because I could get Uromysitisis poisoning and die. That's why!...Do you think I enjoy living like this?...the shame, the humiliation...You know I have been issued a public urination pass by the city because of my condition. Unfortunately my little brother ran out of the house with it this morning. Him and his friends are probably peeing all over the place. You want to call the Department of Social Services? Oh, it's Saturday. They're closed today. My luck. First of all you don't even know technically that I went. That's for starters. I mean I could've been pouring a bottle of water out there. You don't know. Oh really, do you? Well it just so happens that I did pour water out. I had a bottle of very tepid water and I poured it out. And I could see how you made a mistake, because pouring water out sounds very much like a person urinating. And you know when you think about it it's really quite an amusing case of mistaken identity. That's all it is. You know this is not the first time this has happened to me. I always carry water because of my condition. It dehydrates me. It's a vicious cycle. All right, all right. I want to apologize. I was frightened, I said crazy things. I obviously offended you. I insulted your intelligence. The uromysitisis, the water bottle...I made it all up, and now...I'm going to tell you the truth. Today my father and mother are celebrating their fiftieth, well I'm jumping ahead here, their forty-seventh wedding anniversary. We made arrangements to spend the evening together. They are supposed to be in front of my building at six-fifteen. What I haven't told you, or anyone else for that matter, is that my father's been in a Red Chinese prison for the past fourteen years. Was he also in a Red Chinese prison? Well what happened was my father was staying in the home of one of Red China's great military leaders, General Chang, who by the way came up with the recipe for General Chang's chicken. You know, the one with the red peppers and orange peel at Szechwan Gardens? Well General Chang was a very flamboyant man. A complete failure as a general, but a helluva cook. I was arrested for urinating. I have uromysitisis. It's very serious you know. No, but he's not looking good... (ELAINE TURNS TO TWO HUGE BODY BUILDERS IN WORKOUT WEAR) Hey, where's Kramer? Where's Kramer? Hey George, there she is again. ... Ask her to drive us around. There's your opening. Filthy pigs. Jerry. Boy, those Scientologists. They can be pretty sensitive. The car! Kramer! Kramer. Yeah, over here. Oh, it won't be for that long. Hey, my parents are just as crazy as your parents. My father has never thrown anything out. Ever! My mother has never set foot in a natural body of water. A smirk? I told you I'd lend you the money for the rent. What's that? Fine, Mrs. Costanza. Hey, I got a terrific joke for you. No, no. It-It's really funny. There's these two guys- No thanks. I really don't eat it. I don't know if I'd feel comfortable handing out bologna sandwiches in the building.. Well, I guess we'll be going... Yeah. Oh, Elaine and I are going out to dinner with Kramer and his new girlfriend. Yeah, You can't believe this woman. She's one of those low-talkers. You can't hear a word she's saying! You're always going 'excuse me?', 'what was that?' Yeah, take it easy. Right. Well... Excuse me? Yeah.. yeah. Puffy. Yeah, that's right! And the indigent. Sure. Uh-huh. Yep... I - I don't get it. What is it? They're hands! Well, what about my hands? I don't see how your hands are any better than my hands. Well, that's what comes from avoiding manual labor your whole life. It's just like in the movies. Hey. George has become a hand model. Yes. Oven mitts? Alright. Uh-huh… Since I said what? What are you talking about? This? I agreed to wear this?! But, when did I do that? What are you, crazy?! I don't know! I couldn't understand a word she was saying! I was just nodding! Where I go? You mean she was asking me to wear this ridiculous shirt on national TV, and I said 'Yes'?! But, I - I didn't know what she was talking about. I couldn't hear her! I - I can't wear this puffy shirt on TV! I mean, look at it! It looks ridiculous! They're making these? But, I don't want to be a pirate! Kramer, how am I gonna wear this?! I-I can't wear this! Why am I wearing is now?? I'll tell you why I'm wearing it now - because the lowtalker asked me to, that's why! And I said 'yes'. Do you know why? Because I couldn't HEAR her! When we were at dinner, when Kramer went to the bathroom. Of course not! Nobody hears anything when this woman speaks! I have to wear it! The woman has orders for this shirt based on me wearing it on TV.. they're producing them as we speak! Thank you, Bryant. Oh, thank you. Yeah, it's a puffy shirt. Yeah.. like a pirate.. Anyway, ah, you know, we're hoping to, um, raise enough money.. with this.. uh.. Uh-huh, yeah. Look, it's not my shirt. What's the difference? I agreed to wear it. It's - it's a puffy shirt. I feel ridiculous in it, and I think it's the stupidest shirt I've ever seen, to be perfectly honest with you. (Nodding) That I heard. Oh, just keep your voice down. Everyone can hear you. You know, if you talked this loud to begin with, I wouldn't be in this costume in the first place! Yeah. It didn't do me any good either! That benefit was the worst show I ever did. Some of those heckles were really uncalled for: "Avast ye matey" - what the hell does that mean?! "20 degrees off the starboard side - the Spanish Galleon!" - there's no comeback for that! Really? What happened? What happened with all the shirts? You know, it's really not a bad looking shirt.. Oh, sure. Without the parents, it's a breeze. Hey, great party. You have a standard fake? (Notices an attractive woman walking by, starts to follow her) That's neat. Hi, I'm Jerry. You might not know it to look at me, but I can run really, really fast. Hey! How'd it go with the cocktail franks? Didn't you call in sick yesterday? You're gonna open your mail here? See? You give, and you get. Oh, that's nice. To a children's charity! Hey. (Waitress moves tward the table) "Atomic Sub"? Why are you eating there? What does that mean? When George was growing up... His father... Hated all the commercial and religious aspects of Christmas, so he made up his own holiday. And instead of a tree, didn't your father put up an aluminum pole? And weren't there a feats of strength that always ended up with you crying? So? No, you walk out. No, you wait for the movie! You don't need the card. High-end hoagie outfit like that, it's all computerized! [snaps] They're cloning sheep now. So, why don't you just try your blow-off number and see if he's called it? What strike? You? Bagels? Why didn't you ever mention this? Hey, Tim. Actually, I'm having dinner with a girl I met at your party. Gwen? Really? Have you come across this? [relating] Like the Batman villain? So, if I ask her out again - I don't know who's showing up: The good, the bad, or the ugly. Yeah. [reading it] "A donation has been made in your name to the Human Fund." - What is that? [continuing reading] "The Human Fund. Money for people." It has a certain understated stupidity. Yeah. How was your first day? Your hands were in the dough? Happy Festivus! When George was growing up.. His father.. You're still trying to get that free sub? Is there a captain's hat involved in this? Boy, am I glad to see you. You never know. So, uh, what do you feel like eating? Chinese or Italian? You're telling me. Actually, the only place she always looked good was in that back booth over there. I can't just keep bringing her to the coffee shop. I mean, what if things, you know, progress? Alright, I'll give it a shot! I do really like this coffee shop. Nice cuff links, by the way. That's not a french cuff shirt, you know. Oh, that's classy. I there. This is Kramer, and Frank. Uh, why don't we stay here? The back booth just opened up. Now this is a good looking booth. Why? It's our place. Oh.. I know who's cooking today! Hey, Georgie! I'll be here. She didn't touch it. Twenty thousand dollars from Kruger? You're not keeping this. Excuse me? You want to give something back? Start with the 20 thousand dollars. You're going to start your own charity? They nailed you on the 20 G's? Gwen! How'd you know I was here? Gwen. Gwen, wait! Ah! Bad lighting on the porch. I thought you were on strike? Elaine, see this T-shirt, six years I've had this T-shirt. It's my best one, I call him… Golden Boy. Golden Boy’s always the first shirt I wear out of the laundry. Here… touch Golden Boy! But see look at the collar, it's fraying. Golden Boy is slowly dying. Each wash brings him one step closer, that's what makes the T-shirt such a tragic figure. No! The reason he's the iron man is because he goes out there and plays every game. Wash! Spin! Rinse! Spin! You take that away from him, you break his spirit! The guy who’s in the gulag?! You wanna barrow Golden Boy! Hey ya know I read an unbelievable thing about Tolstoy the other day, did you know the original title for "War and Peace" was "War--What Is It Good For?"! No, no… I'm not kidding Elaine it's true, his mistress didn't like the title and insisted that he change it to "War and Peace"! That's were they got it from! I'm not joking! What? Your mother reads your mail? What do you mean like post-cards an...? She doesn't open...? You've caught your mother opening envelopes! What did she say? Isn't that against the law? He can't handle the truth! No. It's a mammal. Yeah, got it from the bank. Hey. I do. I really wanna have fun. Yeah, let me just stop by the cash machine and I'll meet you over at the coffee shop. Cash advance... yes… no balance inquiry... no receipt.... no processing... processing... I won! Yeah. Oh Diane. Good, good. Since college. Yeah pluggin along. Well he's kind of modest. Sure. Marine biology. Yeah, pretty damn good one, too! Yeah... he’s specializing in whales. He's working on lowering the cholesterol level, in whales… all that blubber -- quite unhealthy. You know it’s the largest mammal on earth but as George says "they don't have to be." Something huh? She looked great. She asked about you. "How's George?" Yeah she asked for your number, I think she's gonna get in touch with you. I got no problem with that. Expect a call. Now, I should tell you… that, at this point, she's under the impression that you’re - a - ah… A marine biologist. Yes. I may have mentioned it. Yes I know that. Why, you don't think it's a good job? Oh it's a fascinating field! I did it for you. You know with all do respect I would think it's right up your alley. Well you came in the other day with all that whale stuff, the squeaking and the squealing and… Hey. What? Well what happened? What, what, what's wrong with you? Hey come on, you're getting it all over the floor! Hello… yeah… yes it is… really… ah, ah… Could you hold on a second? Hey listen to this, some woman found an electronic organizer, my name was in it, she wants me to help her track down the owner. She’s waking down the street and it hit her in the head! Wow. Yeah… Well you have insurance... Unbelievable! What is with this thing. Absolutely. You should not have to pay for that. Let me have a look at this thing. Typical rich people, using the world for their personal garbage can. I would like to know what my name’s doin’ in this creep's organizer to begin with. Who do I know who would have even been in a limousine yesterday anyway. Uhh-o h-owow! Oh, there you are! So? So what do you have to say for yourself? Why should I have anything for say for myself? A-Ahahahahah. Who told you? You told Testikov that Tolstoy wanted to name his book "War-- What Is IT Good For?"? Can I take a guess? Oh I don't know, he threw your organizer out the window? [Elaine pushes Jerry] Because I know who has it. Because the woman who got hit in the head with it found my name, called me up, and we met! I don't have it! Because she's not returning it until she gets the money back for the hospital bill. How much is Testikov getting from Pendant for this book? Well that's a start. Well, you want your organizer back don't you? Hey you know when Superman saves someone no one asks if he's trying to hit on her! Well you're not Lois Lane. Yeah I got it. You sure you want to do this? Oh, here she comes. Hi. Elaine, this is Corinne. All right lets go. We'll meet you back down here in ten minutes, hopefully with the money. Yeah. Th-That's why I where these sneakers, in case of any trouble -- zip, I'm gone Oh! Rimsky -- great great book if I may say so sir. I almost read the whole thing. It was nice meeting you… [sarcastically] …you’re a real pleasure. Right in the head! Mammal. Well the-the crowd must have gone wild! Wow! What'd she say? All right let’s go. Ahhh… got my laundry back. He didn't make it. Yeah. This is Golden Boy's son… Baby Blue. Let me ask you a question. You're a hostage, captured by terrorists- You, anybody... whatever. You're in the little room, you're chained to the floor, you're there for a long time.. do you think they would ever consider doing the laundry? Hi. What's the matter? Caught you? Doing what? Where? Glamour? So, what did she do? What did you do? No, I wouldn't think so. Glamour? [skeptical] Ohhh yeah… right. C’mon. No chance. Well, I know I could hold out longer than you. Sure, how much? [pointing] You're on. You? You'll be out before we get the check. Ohh, no. No, no, no… It's apples and oranges.. No, no, no, no... Because you're a woman! It's easier for a woman not to do it than a man. We have to do it. It's part of our lifestyle. It's like, uh.. shaving. [nodding] Okay, one-fifty. Well, obviously, we all know each other very well, I'm sure that we'll all feel comfortable within the confines of the honor system. …Yeah? How is she? Yeah? Come on up. Dating Marla. Yeah. Well, I got my troops amassed along the border - I'm just waiting for someone to give me the go-ahead. Where? [also amazed] Who walks around the house like that?! Hey, let me ask you a question. In these nudist colonies, do they eat naked in the dining room? What about the chamber maids? Are they naked, too? Hey. Not me. There's a naked woman across the street. [commenting] Yeah.. the-the waitress should've taken it back. Uh-huh. Slow it down? Ah, yeah… I know. Yeah, yeah… of course. What, do you think I care about the sex? What kind of person do you think I am? That doesn't mean anything to me. [faint] I don't care about that. [smiling, nodding] Sure, Saturday night. Goodnight. Not just a good night... a great night. [out of it] Yeah, good morning. She's not there. She's doin' her wash. Yes, I'm proud to say I did! [nodding] Yes. Yes I am. Master of my domain. But I will tell you this... I am going over to her apartment, and I'm tellin' her to put those shades down! I can't take it anymore! She's driving me crazy! I can't sleep, I can't leave the house, and I' here, I'm climbin' the walls. Meanwhile, I'm dating a virgin, I'm in this contest - something's gotta give! Look, I'm sorry... Kramer, get outta my way! Alright.. …Alright. She's not there! So the nurse was giving her a sponge bath? Oh, man. Well, I guess you'll be going back to that hospital. But are you still master of your domain? Lord of the manor. (Elaine enters and sits next to Jerry) What? Really? Did you talk to him? [fake praise] Good one. But the question is, are you still master of your domain? Alright, Ma, I'll talk to you later... Nothing, I'm, I'm watching, uh, Tiny Toons here, on Nickelodeon... It's, I-I like kid shows. They have a very innocent, wholesome quality... [singing] The wheels on the bus go round and round, round and round, round and round. The wheels on the bus… (Kramer joins in with Jerry, only, he has a different version) I don't keep real coffee in here, I get my coffee on the outside! [shouting] Come on up! I don't know. How are these your socks?! [sarcastic] Oh, yeah, that's right, well, you fell asleep one day on the sofa and I took them off your stinkin' feet. They looked so good to me, I just had to have them! They're my socks! (a brief moment passes as they look at each other) What are we doing here.. This is ridiculous. I haven't been myself lately. I've been snapping at everybody. It's over? Ohh-my-God. The Queen is dead. What happened? Ohhhhh.. John-John. But you made it through the day before. Why outside here? Alright, Costanza - it's just you and me. Really? You sure? You really want to? Okay.. [chuckles] You don't know the half of it. Well, it's kinda silly, but.. No, it was just a bet. I mean, it actually started with George and his mother- I told her about the contest. Marla? [shocked] Oh my God in heaven!
